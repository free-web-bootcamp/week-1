# Welcome to Week 1, Day 1 of the Bootcamp!

### Prerequisite

Please complete the "Set up" playlist of videos if you don't already have the following:

- Code editor
- Terminal / Console
- Folder structure for Week 1
- GitHub account (to help create your online portfolio)

### Link to Week 1 Playlist on YouTube

TBA

### Learning Objective Day 1

1. Understand and write HTML webpages (very important that you don't rush this concept)
2. Ability to self learn by understanding documentation such as https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
3. Create an HTML webpage from scratch using documentation online and developer tools in your web browser (important - developers need these skills)

### What skills will I have at the end of week 1?

You will be able to create websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript. These websites will be committed to GitHub and hosted on GitHub pages (or another service of your choice).

This is a great way to understand how websites work and gain the confidence of creating and hosting your own personal website on the internet!

### How long should this take?

Day 1 should take as long as neccessary before you're comfortable creating HTML webpages.

Note:

Even though it is week 1 of the bootcamp, please take longer if you need it. I personally learned these concepts over 12 weeks during lunch breaks at work, so there's no rush!

### I'm done, what is next

Study the material a second time so that it has time to sink in. Once you're ready, head on over to day two. Keep up the good work!

### When is week two released?

I'm doing my best to create meaningful content and provide a bootcamp experience to help people find work as developers. For this, I cannot rush. The content will be on its way as soon as possible.

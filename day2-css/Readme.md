### Learning Objectives

1. Learn CSS
2. Use Classes and IDâ€™s
3. Google Styles
4. Add external CSS (Bootstrap)

### What skills will I have at the end of week 1?

You will be able to create websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript. These websites will be committed to GitHub and hosted on GitHub pages (or another service of your choice).

This is a great way to understand how websites work and gain the confidence of creating and hosting your own personal website on the internet!

### How long should this take?

Even though it is week 1 of the bootcamp, please take longer if you need it. I personally learned these concepts over 12 weeks during lunch breaks at work, so there's no rush!

### When is week two released?

I'm doing my best to create meaningful content and provide a bootcamp experience to help people find work as developers. For this, I cannot rush. The content will be on its way as soon as possible.
